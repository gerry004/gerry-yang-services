          As a software engineer (link), I co-founded Kreoh Education, where I built a full-stack web platform in just 6 weeks, used by over 100 students at UCD and the University of Limerick. I also worked at Noloco (YCS21) for 6 months, contributing numerous sought-after features that enhanced their no-code platform.
